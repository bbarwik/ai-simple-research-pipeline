PrivateAI is an ambitious open-source project building the first user-friendly 'second brain' designed to run entirely on a user's local hardware. Its core mission is to empower individuals by granting them full sovereignty over their digital data, providing personalized insights, automation, and intelligent assistance without compromising privacy. The system intelligently captures and organizes a user's digital life. Starting with a macOS desktop MVP, PrivateAI combines a free open-source core with a sustainable business model offering paid convenience features and a plugin marketplace, targeting users who seek digital autonomy and a truly private AI experience.
