      "question": "Given the founder's preference to avoid extensive people management and focus on R&D, what specific plan is in place to appoint a strong operational leader (e.g., CEO or COO) to manage the growing team, business development, and day-to-day operations, especially as the company scales?",
      "rationale": "The founder's stated preference for R&D over people management is a known trait for many technical founders. However, scaling a company, especially to achieve a $100M valuation and manage a team of ~10 people post-seed, requires strong operational leadership. Understanding the plan for filling this critical executive role is essential for assessing execution risk.",
      "expected_signal": "A clear strategy for recruiting or empowering an operational co-founder or CEO, potentially with a timeline and identified candidate profiles. Evidence of successful delegation and a plan for talent acquisition (e.g., a strong People Manager / Team Lead role already being prioritized or filled).",

      "rationale": "The document acknowledges that 'Evidence for broader market pain beyond the tech-savvy niche needs further validation.' This is a critical market risk as scaling beyond early adopters requires addressing the needs and comfort levels of a wider audience. Understanding the strategy to bridge this gap is crucial for market penetration.",
      "expected_signal": "Demonstrated market research or user studies on mainstream users' pain points and willingness to adopt local AI. Concrete plans for simplifying installation/setup, a 'plug-and-play' hardware offering, or tiered feature sets that gradually introduce complexity. A refined messaging strategy for the mainstream.",

A clear, detailed roadmap is crucial for investors to understand the path to these aggressive targets.",

      "rationale": "The project promises unparalleled privacy but also mentions optional features like cloud processing and targeting diverse regions (EU, Arab countries, China) with varying data regulations. The document notes that 'Ethical Boundaries for Data Handling needs to be formally defined and decided upon later.' Without a robust legal and ethical framework established early, the project faces significant regulatory risks and could undermine user trust, which is its core value proposition.",

A formal definition of 'Ethical Boundaries for Data Handling' and a roadmap for its implementation.

      "rationale": "The ability to capture a user's 'entire digital life' is central to PrivateAI's value proposition, yet the document explicitly states that full background screen monitoring on smartphones is challenging due to OS restrictions. This represents a significant technical hurdle for mobile integration, which is crucial for a complete 'second brain' experience. Understanding how this core technical limitation will be overcome or strategically navigated is vital.",
      "expected_signal": "A concrete technical roadmap for mobile data capture that moves beyond user-initiated actions and cloud folder monitoring. This might involve exploring more advanced (but still privacy-compliant) OS-level integrations, foreground app capture focus, or specific partnerships. A clear definition of how the 'entire digital life' claim will apply to mobile, given these constraints.",
