      "question": "What is the specific open-source license intended for the core project, and how will it legally enforce the 'non-commercial use only' restriction, allowing for commercial monetization strategies?",
      "rationale": "The project explicitly states the open-source version will be 'free for private, non-commercial use only' to prevent unauthorized commercial use but grow the project. However, the choice of license to achieve this while maintaining a truly open-source ethos is critical for legal compliance, community perception, and the commercial business model's viability. This requires careful legal consideration, as many traditional open-source licenses do not easily permit such restrictions.",
      "expected_signal": "A clear articulation of the chosen open-source license (e.g., AGPL, SSPL, or a custom license) and a legal strategy for enforcing the non-commercial clause, along with examples of other successful projects that have used a similar dual-licensing or tiered open-source model.",

      "question": "Given the founder's preference to focus on R&D rather than management, what is the concrete plan to recruit an experienced CTO or dedicated People Manager/Team Lead immediately post-funding to manage the growing team and operational aspects?",
      "rationale": "The founder, while visionary, explicitly states a preference for R&D and disinterest in people management. Scaling a company to 10,000 users and $250k MRR requires strong leadership beyond technical R&D, particularly in team management, operational efficiency, and potentially external technical representation. Not having this role clearly filled or a plan to recruit it quickly can bottleneck growth and operational execution.",
      "expected_signal": "A detailed recruitment plan for a CTO and/or dedicated People Manager, including target profiles, proposed compensation (e.g., equity), and a timeline for their integration into the team. Evidence of outreach or initial conversations would be positive.",

Prefers to avoid extensive people management associated with a CTO role in a larger company and is open to finding a replacement CTO after achieving a higher valuation because he wants to focus on R&D, not management."

      "question": "What is the detailed strategy for user acquisition beyond 'target the technical community first' and 'collaborate with YouTubers,' specifically what marketing budget will be allocated for paid acquisition to reach the stated goal of 10,000 paying users within the first year?",
      "rationale": "Achieving 10,000 paying users generating $250k MRR within a year is an aggressive target. While relying on organic growth from open-source and community engagement is valuable, it might not be sufficient for such rapid scaling. A clear understanding of the broader go-to-market strategy, including paid acquisition channels, budget allocation, and expected CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), is crucial to evaluate the feasibility of these financial targets.",
      "expected_signal": "A breakdown of initial marketing spend, specific channels beyond organic (e.g., AI/privacy-focused publications, developer platforms), expected KPIs for each channel, and a realistic customer acquisition cost model to support the user growth projections.",

      "question": "What core ethical guidelines and formal boundaries will be defined and implemented for data handling and AI behavior to prevent misuse of the technology and address potential liability for AI errors?",
      "rationale": "The project aims to process highly personal and sensitive data ('full spectrum of your digital life'). Without clear ethical boundaries and formalized oversight, there's a significant risk of misuse (e.g., surveillance), privacy breaches, or adverse consequences from incorrect AI outputs. The document notes 'Ethical Boundaries for Data Handling: TODO - This needs to be formally defined and decided upon later,' indicating a critical missing piece of the strategy that needs to be addressed early in development.",
      "expected_signal": "A proposed framework for ethical AI, including principles guiding data collection, processing, and output. Mechanisms for user consent, data redaction, data deletion, and AI output verification. Consideration of appointing an ethics board or similar oversight as the project scales.",

      "rationale": "While the MVP focuses on macOS, the vision targets a broad audience and global market. Desktop data collection (screen, audio, etc.) has OS-specific implementations. The document mentions that 'Browser automation and support for Linux/Windows might also be deferred from the absolute initial MVP.' Deferring these could delay market penetration and limit addressable market size, especially if global expansion is a key strategy.",
      "expected_signal": "A detailed plan for phasing in Windows and Linux desktop support, including resource allocation and timelines. Clarification on how cross-platform consistency in data collection and user experience will be maintained across different operating systems and devices, especially regarding challenging aspects like screen/audio capture.",
