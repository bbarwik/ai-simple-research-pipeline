      "question": "What is the detailed intellectual property strategy concerning patents, trademarks, and open-source licensing to protect the core technology and brand, especially when allowing local compilation of plugins?",
      "rationale": "The project plans to be open-source but restrict commercial use, while licensing to local companies and allowing community contributions. This creates a complex IP landscape. Additionally, the initial idea of local compilation of Rust plugins, if not carefully managed (WASM is preferred as mitigation), adds complexity. A clear IP strategy is crucial to protect the core innovations, prevent unauthorized commercial exploitation, and manage legal risks associated with an open-source model combined with commercial aspirations.",
      "expected_signal": "A clear legal framework for the dual-licensing model, outlining the chosen open-source license, how commercial restrictions will be enforced, and plans for patenting novel technical solutions (if any) to prevent competitors from copying key innovations. Concrete plans for trademarking the brand 'PrivateAI' and related names.",

      "question": "Given the founder's preference for R&D over management, what specific plan is in place for recruiting a People Manager/Team Lead and a replacement CTO as the company scales to ensure effective team leadership and operational management?",
      "rationale": "The founder's desire to focus on R&D is a strength for innovation but poses a risk to management and operational scaling. Having a clear plan for bringing in leadership capable of managing a growing team is crucial for the company's long-term success and to prevent potential bottlenecks in execution.",
      "expected_signal": "A detailed recruitment roadmap for management roles, including desired profiles, timelines, and how the ESOP will be leveraged to attract top talent. Clarity on how responsibilities will transition and overlap during the initial growth phase.",

      "rationale": "The targets for user acquisition and monthly recurring revenue are ambitious for a new open-source, local-first product. While initial target segments are identified, a concrete, actionable go-to-market strategy for conversion to paid users and sustained revenue generation is critical for proving market fit and securing future funding rounds.",
      "expected_signal": "A detailed step-by-step go-to-market plan outlining specific marketing channels, conversion funnels for user acquisition, pricing strategies to encourage sign-ups, and customer retention mechanisms to ensure recurring revenue.

      "rationale": "The core promise of local-first AI hinges on the ability to run powerful models on user-owned hardware. While models are becoming more efficient, current requirements are still high. A strategy for continuous optimization, adaptation to new models, and managing user expectations regarding hardware investments is crucial.",
      "expected_signal": "A concrete strategy for model updates (download, resource allocation, compatibility), an analysis of anticipated hardware cost reductions (e.g., 10x mentioned over 2-3 years) and how this aligns with user accessibility, and a plan for supporting a range of hardware configurations without degrading the core experience.",

The success of this ecosystem depends on attracting developers, providing secure and easy-to-use tools, and creating a fair monetization model. Details are needed beyond charging a 10-20% commission.",
