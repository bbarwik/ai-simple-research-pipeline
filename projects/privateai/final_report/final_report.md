## Company & product

PrivateAI addresses the pervasive problem of fragmented digital lives and the associated privacy risks of surrendering personal data to third-party cloud services (source: FS5HHF). In today's hyper-connected world, personal information is scattered across countless apps and devices, often inaccessible or compromised. The core problem is the lack of a comprehensive, intelligent, and private system that helps individuals harness their own digital footprint (source: FS5HHF).

The solution is PrivateAI: an open-source, local-first "personal AI second brain" (source: FS5HHF). It is designed to be an intelligent assistant residing on the user's own computer or a private server they control (source: FS5HHF). The primary value proposition is unparalleled privacy, deep personalization, user control, and open extensibility (source: FS5HHF).

Key differentiators include:
*   **Truly Private:** All data processing and storage occur locally on user hardware, ensuring data never leaves user control (source: FS5HHF).
*   **Deeply Personalized:** By accessing a comprehensive view of the user's digital life (with explicit permission), PrivateAI builds a rich understanding, enabling a level of personalized assistance generic AIs cannot match (source: FS5HHF).
*   **User-Controlled & Empowering:** Users decide what data is accessed and how it's processed (source: FS5HHF).
*   **Open & Extensible:** An open-source foundation with a modular plugin system encourages community contributions and extends capabilities (source: FS5HHF).

**Architecture Overview:**
The recommended system model is a dual-app structure: a light client application for local data collection and UI, and a headless server application for intensive data processing, AI model hosting, and database management (source: FS5HHF). An alternative considers three components: a web-based client UI, a native client binary for data collection, and the headless server (source: FS5HHF).

**Data Flows and Technical Bets:**
1.  **Data Collection Layer:** Modular plugins gather data from diverse sources (screen activity, audio, clipboard, files, browser activity, email). Initially, these plugins write raw data files to monitored directories on the server for processing (source: FS5HHF).
2.  **Data Processing Layer:** Server-side plugins process the raw data. AI models for vision (Qwen2.5-VL), speech-to-text (WhisperX), and large language models (local LLMs like Llama 2 via Ollama) are hosted on the server. Processing is scheduled to optimize resource use (source: FS5HHF).
3.  **Data Analysis Layer:** Higher-level plugins (web-based "apps") access processed data from the server's database to provide insights. These apps can also schedule tasks on the client (source: FS5HHF).
4.  **Data Storage:** Processed data, text, and embeddings are stored in a database. SQLite is recommended for the MVP, potentially with DuckDB for analytical queries (source: FS5HHF). Vector embeddings will be crucial for semantic search, using solutions like SQLite with vector extensions (source: FS5HHF).
5.  **Plugin Ecosystem Security:** A critical technical bet is the secure implementation of the plugin system. While local compilation of Rust source was an initial idea, WebAssembly (WASM) is strongly recommended for sandboxed execution due to security and usability concerns (source: FS5HHF).
6.  **Remote Access:** Secure tunnels via VPNs, Tailscale, or Cloudflare Tunnel are planned for remote access to the server, with strong authentication and TLS encryption (source: FS5HHF).
7.  **Data Management:** Strategies for data deduplication (block-level, potentially AI-powered semantic), lifecycle management (archival, summarization, deletion policies), and robust encryption (at rest, in transit, and for backups) are foundational (source: FS5HHF).

Constraints and challenges include the high technical resource requirements for local AI models, mobile data collection limitations due to OS restrictions, and the need for rigorous security in the plugin architecture (source: FS5HHF). The project emphasizes user transparency and granular control at every stage (source: FS5HHF).
