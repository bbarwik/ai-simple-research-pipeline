## Company & product
The proliferation of digital information across countless applications and devices leads to fragmented personal data and constant privacy concerns with third-party cloud services (source: X4ZU4W). PrivateAI directly addresses this problem by offering a Truly Personal AI Second Brain (source: X4ZU4W). This system eliminates privacy compromises by operating entirely on the user's local hardware or a private server they control, ensuring data never leaves their trusted environment (source: X4ZU4W).

PrivateAI's unique value proposition lies in its truly private, deeply personalized, user-controlled, and open-source nature. Unlike most AI assistants, it processes all data locally, retaining user sovereignty. By accessing a comprehensive view of the user's digital life (with explicit permissions), it develops a nuanced understanding, enabling personalized assistance beyond generic AI capabilities (source: X4ZU4W). Its open and extensible design, including a modular plugin system, fosters community contributions and broadens its capabilities (source: X4ZU4W).

The solution's core functionalities include:
*   **Memory Amplification & Knowledge Management:** Effortlessly recalling any information encountered, indexing the digital world for instant search and query, and managing/summarizing documents (source: X4ZU4W).
*   **Task & Productivity Automation:** Automatically creating to-do lists, managing calendars, drafting communications, and automating repetitive digital chores (source: X4ZU4W).
*   **Personalized Insights:** Offering insights into productivity, learning habits, and budget management by privately observing activity patterns (source: X4ZU4W).

*   **Digital Life Organization:** Managing and organizing documents, notes, and digital assets for easy accessibility (source: X4ZU4W).

**Architecture Overview:**
PrivateAI utilizes a dual-app model comprising a lightweight client application (for local data collection and UI) and a headless server application (for computationally intensive data processing, AI model hosting, database management, and API provisioning) (source: X4ZU4W). A potential refinement suggests three components: a web-based Client UI, a native Client Binary (daemon/agent for data collection), and the headless Server application. The core system will orchestrate all components and plugins, providing APIs for various interactions (source: X4ZU4W).

**Data Flows:**
*   **Data Collection Layer:** Modular plugins gather raw data from various sources (screen activity, audio, clipboard, files, browser activity, email) and transmit it to the server. The initial approach involves plugins writing data files to monitored directories on the server, which are then processed and archived (source: X4ZU4W).
*   **Data Processing Layer:** Server-side plugins process data pipelines. These plugins obtain data from the server, with their dependencies detailed in manifests. Data is archived only after all relevant processing is complete (source: X4ZU4W). The server hosts LLM models, potentially integrating with tools like Ollama or llama-server, and processing is scheduled based on resource availability (source: X4ZU4W).
*   **Data Analysis Layer:** Higher-level plugins or "apps" access processed data from the server's database to provide insights and functionalities. These can schedule "Tasks" on client instances for local resource access (source: X4ZU4W). Analysis plugins written in JS/TS will be sandboxed using WebAssembly (WASM) (source: X4ZU4W).

**Key Technical Bets & Constraints:**
*   **Local-First AI Processing:** Leveraging cutting-edge open-source AI models (Qwen2.5-VL for vision, WhisperX for speech-to-text, Llama 2, Phi-3, Mistral 7B for LLMs) that run efficiently on user-owned hardware (e.g., Mac mini) (source: X4ZU4W). This is foundational to the privacy promise.
*   **Plugin Ecosystem & Security:** A modular plugin system supports Rust for data collection and JavaScript/TypeScript/Python for data analysis (source: X4ZU4W). A critical technical bet is the adoption of WebAssembly (WASM) for sandboxed plugin execution to mitigate security risks associated with locally compiled code (source: X4ZU4W).
*   **Data Storage:** Initial MVP recommends SQLite for metadata, application state, and structured data, potentially complemented by DuckDB for high-performance analytical queries. Vector embeddings (for semantic search) will be stored using local options like ChromaDB, FAISS, or SQLite with vector search extensions (source: X4ZU4W).
*   **Mobile Constraints:** Continuous background screen monitoring and detailed UI event capture are largely infeasible on non-jailbroken iOS/Android due to OS restrictions, limiting mobile functionality to user-initiated actions and selective integrations (source: X4ZU4W).
