## Company & product

PrivateAI addresses the problem of fragmented, inaccessible, and insecure personal data spread across countless apps and devices (source: 74ZX4W). In today's hyper-connected world, individuals create and consume vast amounts of information, yet their digital footprint often remains beyond their control, primarily handled by third-party cloud services where privacy is a constant concern (source: 74ZX4W).

The solution is PrivateAI, a "Truly Personal AI Second Brain" that resides on the user's computer or a private server they control (source: 74ZX4W). It functions as an intelligent assistant, remembering information, understanding unique contexts, and proactively helping users navigate their digital world, all while ensuring data never leaves the trusted environment (source: 74ZX4W). Its core concept is to be the first truly private, open-source, and user-friendly AI solution that anyone can easily run locally (source: 74ZX4W).

The unique value proposition (UVP) of PrivateAI lies in its pioneering approach to private, user-friendly AI, innovative data utilization (including browser automation, vision, and sound), unparalleled privacy and security through local processing, deep personalization, and its open, extensible, and user-controlled design (source: 74ZX4W).

### Architecture overview

PrivateAI proposes a dual-app model (source: 74ZX4W):
*   **Client Application:** A lightweight, web-based UI focused on local data collection and user interface (source: 74ZX4W).
*   **Headless Server Application:** Handles computationally intensive data processing, AI model hosting, database management, and API provisioning (source: 74ZX4W). This allows for flexible deployment, such as a MacBook Air client with a Mac Mini server (source: 74ZX4W).

### Data flows & collection
Data collection occurs via modular plugins from a maximum number of feasible sources, including screen activity, audio (transcribed locally), clipboard, files, browser activity, and email (source: 74ZX4W). Client-to-server data transfer is initially envisioned through plugins writing files to monitored directories, with more robust Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms like gRPC or message queues recommended for later stages (source: 74ZX4W).

### Data processing & analysis
All data processing pipelines are implemented as optional server-side plugins (source: 74ZX4W). PrivateAI supports loading and hosting LLM models and schedules processing when system resources are available (source: 74ZX4W). Analysis is performed by higher-level plugins (JavaScript/TypeScript or Python) that access processed data from the server's database (source: 74ZX4W). These analysis plugins can schedule tasks on the client instance (source: 74ZX4W).
