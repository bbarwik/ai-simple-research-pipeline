  digital life to provide personalized insights and automation, ensuring
  complete privacy and user control.  The project emphasizes a local-first AI
  processing approach, a modular plugin system for extensibility, and a
  user-friendly interface.  Key functionalities include memory amplification,
  digital chore automation, personalized insights, research acceleration, and
  digital life organization.  The go-to-market strategy focuses on early
  adopters and expands to mainstream users, with a business model based on paid
  convenience features, a plugin marketplace, and enterprise services, all while
  maintaining a free core.
