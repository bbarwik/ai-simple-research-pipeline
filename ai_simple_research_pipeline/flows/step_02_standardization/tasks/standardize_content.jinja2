# Standardize Document Content to English Markdown

Convert the provided document to clean English Markdown format.

## Content Conversion Requirements

Rewrite the document content faithfully into English Markdown:
- Preserve the original structure and meaning
- Translate non-English content accurately
- Keep all factual information, numbers, and metrics intact
- Remove only redundant marketing fluff or boilerplate text
- Use clear, professional English

## Formatting Rules

- Start headings at ## level (no top-level # headings)
- Do not add screenshots or images - describe visual content when relevant
- Preserve important diagrams as text descriptions or ASCII art if simple
- Keep tables in Markdown format when present
- Use bullet points and numbered lists appropriately

## Accuracy Requirements

- **Do not fabricate** any numbers, dates, or facts
- If content is unclear or illegible, note this inline with [unclear: description]
- For image-only pages (e.g., slide decks), transcribe all visible text
- If technical terms are ambiguous, keep the original term in parentheses
- Maintain the document's tone but standardize to professional language

## Special Handling

- For pitch decks: Preserve slide structure with clear section breaks
- For whitepapers: Maintain academic/technical precision
- For blog posts: Keep informal tone indicators but standardize grammar
- For specifications: Preserve all technical details exactly

## Context

<project_name>{{ project_name }}</project_name>
<original_filename>{{ file_name }}</original_filename>

## Output Format

Output the standardized content directly as clean Markdown, without any preamble or YAML front-matter.
