# Standardize to English Markdown

You will convert the provided document to **clean English Markdown** with a YAML front-matter block.

Create the following YAML front-matter structure at the beginning of your output:

```yaml
---
title: "<infer a precise, descriptive title from the document content>"
original_filename: "{{ file_name }}"
doc_type: "<pitch_deck | whitepaper | blog | spec | other>"
published_or_version_date: "<YYYY-MM-DD format if found, otherwise null>"
language_detected: "<original language code, e.g., en, es, fr, zh>"
summary_improved: "<3â€“6 sentence improved summary capturing key points>"
key_claims:
  - "<main claim or assertion 1>"
  - "<main claim or assertion 2>"
  - "<additional key claims as needed>"
sources:
  - "<internal references, links, or citations found in the document>"
  - "<additional sources if present>"
provenance_notes: "<brief explanation of how you processed/converted this document>"
---
```

## Content Conversion

After the front-matter, rewrite the document content faithfully into English Markdown:

- Preserve the original structure and meaning
- Translate non-English content accurately
- Keep all factual information, numbers, and metrics intact
- Remove only redundant marketing fluff or boilerplate text
- Use clear, professional English

## Formatting Rules

- Start headings at ## level (no top-level # headings)
- Do not add screenshots or images - describe visual content when relevant
- Preserve important diagrams as text descriptions or ASCII art if simple
- Keep tables in Markdown format when present
- Use bullet points and numbered lists appropriately

## Accuracy Requirements

- **Do not fabricate** any numbers, dates, or facts
- If content is unclear or illegible, note this in the provenance_notes
- For image-only pages (e.g., slide decks), transcribe all visible text
- If technical terms are ambiguous, keep the original term in parentheses
- Maintain the document's tone but standardize to professional language

## Special Handling

- For pitch decks: Preserve slide structure with clear section breaks
- For whitepapers: Maintain academic/technical precision
- For blog posts: Keep informal tone indicators but standardize grammar
- For specifications: Preserve all technical details exactly
