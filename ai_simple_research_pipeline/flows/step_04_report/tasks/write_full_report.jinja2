## Required sections (headings must start from ##):

## Executive summary
Write a one-page investor-ready overview covering what the company does, who they serve, and why now is the time.

## Company & product
Detail the problem being solved, the solution approach, value proposition, and key differentiation.
Include architecture overview from sources, data flows, and key technical bets or constraints.

## Market & competition
Analyze TAM/SAM/SOM or nearest proxies, target segments, and go-to-market motion.
Map the competitive landscape and relative positioning.

## Traction & metrics
Present evidence-backed metrics and milestones. Avoid speculation and stick to documented facts.

## Business model & unit economics
Describe the revenue model, pricing strategy, and key cost drivers. Note assumptions clearly when data is missing.

## Team & governance
Cover founders, key roles, hiring gaps, advisors, and ownership structure if present.

## Risks
Insert the 5 risks from the risks.json document with 1-2 sentence narrative for each. Keep consistent with the source.

## Opportunities
Insert the 5 opportunities from opportunities.json with concise justification for each.

## Open questions
List the 5 investor questions from questions.json with one-line rationale for each.

## Investment outlook
Provide base, bull, and bear scenarios with explicit triggers and what would change the investment thesis.

### Constraints
- Use only provided sources; no external facts
- Prefer newer claims when conflicts arise
- Inline cite source filenames in parentheses like (source: <file>.md) when referencing concrete facts
- Do not add a table of contents
